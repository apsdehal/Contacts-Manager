###Contacts Manager
This contact manager is based on laravel framework and backbone.js, use these at your ease.

Kindly make sure to run `php artisan migrate` to make schema same as mine. Also make sure to add `database.php` file in `app/config/` folder from your laravel 4 distribution to make sure everything runs fine. Other neccesary steps for installation of laravel are to be followed as usual.
